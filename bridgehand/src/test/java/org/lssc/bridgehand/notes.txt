1. Was considering whether i should have implemented hashCode, as I implemnented before using a map to meet conventions (i.e. effective Java)
2. Not sure if Rank is the domsin term
3. Get the feeling there might be feature envy between Card and Rank around who knows about points
4. Junit Params better than Junit4 - lacks strong typing.


TODO Tests

Invalid Hand: SAA - duplicate card of same suite
